# alcoholmodelproject
This project models the intake and elimination of alcohol in the body using a Pieters 3-compartment model. A user can model their BAC over time using a simple formula with average values or make the data individualized by inputting their height and weight to see how their BAC changes over time after one or multiple alcoholic drinks.

Made as the final project for an introductory C++ scientific programming university course
